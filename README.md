# 465-Final

Simulating real world phenomena requires managing multiple parts that move independent of each other. Ultimately, we have a matrix of cubes acting as a platform and the user is able to change each of the cubes positions and the platform scale. Having an intuitive UI improves the user experience since there are buttons and text to help guide the user during the simulation. This part of the project also implements direct manipulation of each node including its max y-axis displacement, delta spacing and platform size.
